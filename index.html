            <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <p>Nico Rosberg is a German–Finnish former Formula 1 driver who became the 2016 Formula 1 World Champion with Mercedes. Born on June 27, 1985, in Wiesbaden, Germany, he is the son of 1982 F1 World Champion Keke Rosberg. Nico started his Formula 1 career in 2006 with Williams before joining Mercedes in 2010, where he developed one of the most intense rivalries in the sport’s history with teammate Lewis Hamilton. Across his career, he achieved 23 race victories, 57 podiums, and 30 pole positions, with his crowning moment coming in 2016 when he narrowly beat Hamilton to secure the world title. Just days after winning the championship, he shocked the motorsport world by announcing his retirement, explaining that he wanted to step away at the top of his career and focus on his family. Since leaving Formula 1, Rosberg has built a successful career as a sustainability entrepreneur, investor, and TV pundit. He founded Rosberg X Racing in Extreme E, a racing series for electric off-road vehicles, and has become a strong advocate for renewable energy, clean technology, and environmental awareness. Fluent in five languages and known for his sharp analysis of the sport, Nico Rosberg remains an influential figure both inside and outside of motorsport.</p>
